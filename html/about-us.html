        I am currently a Physics Honours undergrad at the University of Delhi,
        New Delhi. As a bibliophile, I keep searching, reading and reviewing
        books, mostly self-help and finance. From childhood, I have a hunger for
        answers, for truths of life, religion and God. As a course of this, I
        ended up writing my first book 18TEEN to question social and religious
        beliefs. Being an atheist and a physics grad normal answers do not
        satisfy me and this is what discussed in 18TEEN and to encourage people
        to crave truth. <br> <br>
